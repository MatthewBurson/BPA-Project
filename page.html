                In this page we will explain why it is important to Reduce the Carbon Footprint. Carbon Footprint is basically the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person, group, etc. We need to reduce Carbon Footprint, Did you know that there is more extinction in wildlife due to changing ecosystems and habitat loss? Carbon Footprint is so bad right now that there is an Incresage occurence of destructive weather events - like hurricanes, cyclones, droughts and floods. This also affects what you call Climate Change. A good way to reduce your Carbon Footprint would be to make use of energy-saving light bulbs in your home. Another good way would be to find ways to reuse your food waste like eating it the next day or maybe even think about using a composter which decomposes the food into good soil which is good for plants. Maybe even think about reducing, reusing, and recycle all the plastic glass, and paper that you would have thrown away. Recycling could be a big part of reducing Carbon Footprint. The United States have announced 5.5 billion dollars in invesments for new projects around the United States,
              they believe that these projcts will revolutionize how we use and reuse plastic resources. Carbon Footprint really needs to be reduced not only for the people but for the world because it could be really bad if it keeps rising. Help us in reducing Carbon Footprint!
